In this lab, we will showcase how to leverage the newly released Continuous Queries feature in BigQuery to perform real-time sentiment analysis on hotel customer reviews. 
This enables hotels to respond promptly to negative feedback and continuously improve based on positive reviews.

The goal is to demonstrate how to implement a complete end-to-end solution with minimal coding, using a low-code/no-code approach.
